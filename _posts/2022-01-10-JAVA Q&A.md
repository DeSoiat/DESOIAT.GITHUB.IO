# Q 1 ：What is OOP and what is it advantages ?

OOP = Object-Oriented Programming

"Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time " - w3schools

# Q 2 : What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy ?

Shallow copy : Create a pointer then point to a exist RAM address, if the address changed, then the pointer will change with the RAM address.

Deep copy : Clone the data, then create a pointer point to the Cloned data RAM address.

<figure class="table"><table><thead><tr><th>Shallow Copy</th><th>Deep Copy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address. &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.</td></tr><tr><td>Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.</td><td>Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.</td></tr><tr><td>Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects.</td><td>Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Shallow copy is faster.</td><td>Deep copy is comparatively slower.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

# Q 3 : What is garbage collector ?

"Java applications obtain objects in memory as needed. It is the task of garbage collection (GC) in the Java virtual machine (JVM) to automatically determine what memory is no longer being used by a Java application and to recycle this memory for other uses." - ["What is Garbage Collection in Java
and Why is it Important?" by John Worthington](https://www.eginnovations.com/blog/what-is-garbage-collection-java/)
